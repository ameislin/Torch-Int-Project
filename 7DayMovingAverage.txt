Tests results are meant to be reported the day of the result or that the patient is notified, but often there are backups and tests are reported in bulk for days prior to the report. There appears to be an increase of reported results Tuesday to Friday each week, which could be caused by the bulk reporting but it is unclear. Using the 7 day trend instead will give a better metric to evaluate the overall trend from week to week as it won't be affected any short backups in reporting. 

When looking at the 7 day trendm there's a much smaller deviation day to day except for the most recent days. Their site warns that the most recent 3 days typically will change or be updated as it takes time to have the data reported and gathered. This data was pulled on 4/22/2021 so I would not look past 4/18/2021.
