This number includes all of the United States, including the territories that report test results as well. The few that do report are a very small number though and can be excluded in the future if desired. The tests are meant to represent the individual specimens, not people, and exclude serology tests when that distinction is reported. Not all testing sites are included in this, so it is meant to represent most of the United States test, not all of them.
